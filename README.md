# diffmpc

Differentiable model predictive control tool with support for execution on the GPU. This repository includes code to reproduce results in Section 4 of the manuscript "Differentiable Model Predictive Control on the GPU".


## Installation

This code was tested with Python 3.10.12 on Ubuntu 22.04.5.

We recommend installing the package in a virtual environment. First, run
```bash
python -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Upgrade pip and install all dependencies by running:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The package can be installed by running
```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```
To enable CUDA support, you may need to install an extra. For cuda 12, this would be:
```bash
pip uninstall -y jax jaxlib
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12]"
```

## Benchmarking
Scripts and instructions for rerunning benchmarks are in `benchmarking`


## Testing
The following unit tests should pass:
```bash
python -m pytest tests
```
